  About me
</h2>

<p>
  At the moment I am working as the Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://ioki.com">ioki</a>, a Deutsche Bahn company,
  leading the technical branch of the company and building new moblility solutions and demand responsive transport platforms.

  Additionally, I am highly interested in programming tools, concepts, and of course, programming languages in general, currently Elixir. As well as my long time favorites Ruby, JavaScript and Postgres.
